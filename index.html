        <p>
            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaɫdu]; born 5
            February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains the Portugal
            national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or
            awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his
            career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, and the UEFA European Championship.
            Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League,
            goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (117), and international appearances by a
            European (191). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and
            has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country.

            At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was
            impressed with his dribbling.[22] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16,
            under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[17] A year later, on
            29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Braga and on 7 October, he scored
            two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[23] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his
            representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan
            Laporta.[24] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's grounds
            in November to discuss a possible transfer.[25]
